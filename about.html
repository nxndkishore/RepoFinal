						<p>In Bihar and Jharkhand, nine out of every 10 children aged 6-23 do not get an adequate diet. The nutrition and health status of children in these two States has been found to be “critically low” in comparison to the national standard.

According to National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015-16) data, only 7.5% and 7.2% of children in Bihar and Jharkhand respectively in this age group receive an adequate diet, according to a trend analysis of the NFHS-4 data released by the NGO, Child Rights and You (CRY). The comparative figure in the case of Tamil Nadu, for instance, is 31%.

CRY’s findings indicate that inadequate provision of quality antenatal care, and the States’ failure to address the special nutritional requirements of expecting and lactating mothers are negatively affecting child health.

“Malnourishment in early years is directly linked to maternal health…only 3.3% of mothers in Bihar and 8% of mothers in Jharkhand had access to full antenatal care services,” said a CRY release on its trend analysis. “Moreover, more than one-third of the total births in the two States continue to remain home births.”The NFHS-4 data on child-feeding practices and the nutritional status of children further suggest that almost two-thirds of children under the age of three years in these two States (65% in Bihar and 67% in Jharkhand) are not breastfed within the first hour of birth, noted the CRY analysis. “Child malnutrition is an irreversible phenomenon in the lives of children. Its effects are felt through adolescent and adult life”, said Ms. Mohua Chatterjee, a programme head at CRY.</p>

						<h3 class="about__title">What we do</h3>
						<div class="experience__item">
							<h4>Nourishment Ensurement through local outlets andd schools</h4>
							<p>We provide food kits and other nutrients in packages that can be easily consumed by the children.</p>
<p>We accomplish this by delivering a highly nutritious meal, that was  developed by food scientists to provide a rich source of easily digestible protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins needed by an  undernourished child’s body and mind. The food is also acceptable to the broad diversity of ethnic tastes and religious differences around the world. The food offers all nine of the essential amino acids required for complete nutrition, something that can’t be said about other typical food relief sources such as rice or beans alone. It is also very simple to prepare, requiring only six cups of boiling water to make a complete meal.</p>
</div>
						<div class="experience__item">
							<h4>Funding</h4>
							<p>The major portion of our funding comes from NRI supporters. We also recieve support from communities from within India suporting the caause</p>
<p>Last year we received about 52.78Cr from funding and we spent more than 50Cr as food supplements alone.</p>
